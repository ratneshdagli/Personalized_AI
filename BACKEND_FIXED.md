# Personalized AI Feed - Backend Connectivity Fixed

## ✅ What's Fixed

Your Flutter app backend connectivity has been completely fixed! Here's what was done:

### 1. **API Configuration Updated**
- Fixed API URLs to use correct backend endpoints
- Added platform-aware configuration (Android emulator vs localhost)
- Added proper error handling and debugging

### 2. **Backend Server Running**
- Backend is now running on `http://localhost:8000`
- API endpoints are working correctly
- Feed data is being served properly

### 3. **Environment Setup**
- Created `.env` file with proper configuration
- Backend dependencies are installed

## 🚀 How to Run

### Backend (Already Running)
The backend server is already running in the background. If you need to restart it:

```bash
cd flutter_backend
python main.py
```

### Flutter App
Now you can run your Flutter app and it will connect to the live backend:

```bash
cd flutter_application_1
flutter run
```

## 📱 Platform-Specific URLs

The app now automatically detects the platform and uses the correct URL:

- **Android Emulator**: `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api`
- **iOS Simulator**: `http://localhost:8000/api`
- **Web/Desktop**: `http://localhost:8000/api`

## 🔍 Debugging

The app now includes extensive debugging information:
- API configuration details are printed to console
- Network errors are properly logged
- Backend health checks are performed
- Response status and data length are logged

## 📊 What You'll See

Instead of dummy data, you'll now see:
- Live feed items from the backend
- Real API responses
- Proper error handling if backend is down
- Debug information in the console

## 🛠️ Backend Features Available

Your backend provides:
- `/api/feed` - Personalized feed items
- `/api/tasks` - Task management
- `/api/search` - Search functionality
- Various connector endpoints (Gmail, WhatsApp, etc.)

The backend is now fully functional and serving real data to your Flutter app!
